| wrong_sentiment | Predicted sentiment differs from gold label | Gold: negative, Predicted: positive |
| missed_positive_aspect | LLM ignores an important positive phrase | Review praises acting, output only discusses pacing |
| missed_negative_aspect | LLM ignores an important negative phrase | Review says "weak pacing", output omits it |
| wrong_aspect_polarity | Aspect found but polarity is wrong | "slow pacing" marked as positive |
| invalid_json | Output is not valid JSON or has extra prose | Markdown text instead of JSON only |
| hallucinated_evidence | Evidence phrase is not present in the review | Adds "great director" when review never says it |
| overconfident | Confidence is high for ambiguous/mixed review | Very mixed review but confidence = high |
